# 6 Setup guide
1. Copy the SQL code in the file "SQL.sql" and execute it to your MySQL supported database.

2. Open the file “database.php” in the folder “config” and re-save the file with to your database credentials.

3. Upload the folder “News2.0” to your PHP supported server and navigate to the page “create_user.php” to create your admin login credentials.

4. Login with your created admin credentials to be able to start managing news.

## 6.1 Code snippets
The following code can be put on any page to display the latest news - as long as the page is saved with the file extension “.php”. The default setting is to display the 10 latest entries, but you can modify this number in the "news_entries.php" file:

```php
<?php include "news_entries.php"; ?>
```

You can also create new admin-protected pages by placing the following code at the top of each page file you want protected:

```php
<?php
session_start();
if (!isset($_SESSION['user'])) {
    header('Location: login.php');
}
?>
```
